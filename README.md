#Behavioral Cloning using Deep Learning
**P3 Submission for Self-Driving Car Nanodegree**
##Overview
The overall methodology followed in this project is as follows:
 1. Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
 2. Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
 3. Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
 4. Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
 5. If there are any "accidents", fine-tune the hyperparameters, the architecture and get more data on corner cases
